# üõ†Ô∏è LHD: Build 2022

Welcome to my LHD: Build portfolio, where you'll find my hackathon projects and programs for MLH's LHD: Build 2022. Most of these are small and simple ‚Äî given the very limited amounts of time I have to spend on coding, this is how I'm making sure to meet my goal of coding as often as possible, even if it means reviewing familiar concepts or taking tiny steps forward in my learning journey. ***(Note: Local Hack Day is now being rebranded as Global Hack Week!)***

### [Visit the microsite to see some submissions live-hosted: https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/)

### ‚õÖ [Day 1](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/weather.html)

I chose the **weather script** *(write a script that checks the weather)* challenge for [day 1 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-1.devpost.com/). My submission consisted of a few `HTML` and `CSS` files, but the star is the JS script (located in the `day1` folder of this repo) ‚Äî it uses `async/await` to fetch information from the OpenWeatherMap API, then dynamically updates the HTML to display weather information for the user's desired city.

*You can also view it on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/weather-checker) and at [its page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/weather.html)!*

### üîÄ [Day 2](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/reversestr.html)

I chose the **string reverse** *(write a script to reverse a string)* challenge for [day 2 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-2.devpost.com/). My submission once again included `HTML` and `CSS` files, with a super simple `JavaScript` program (located in the `day2` folder) as the real star of the show. The JS script uses a `for` loop to add each character of the user-inputted string, starting from the end (last character of its index), into the `reversedStr` variable. The HTML is then dynamically updated to display the resulting reversed string.

Given the simplicity of this challenge, I decided to add a "Copy string" button to learn how to interact with the clipboard using JavaScript. The script detects whether the string is empty, as well as whether the clipboard write was successful, and returns/displays a message to the user based on these checks. If all goes well, the message just says "Copied!"

### üñΩ [Day 3](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/day3/tailwind.html)

I chose the **front-end framework** *(build with a front-end framework)* challenge for [day 3 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-3.devpost.com/). This mini-project (unsurprisingly) involved `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`, but instead of using the W3.CSS framework like I did for the rest of my `lhd_build` Pages site, I tried incorporating [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) ‚Äî and I must say, I had an absolute blast coding the day 3 page. 

With the help of some [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) components, I created a fully responsive page that I personally think has a quite professional look to it (obviously, the design, content and everything can be improved further, but my focus here was to learn the basics of Tailwind). I decided to implement a dark mode as well, which was lots of fun: the light and dark styles can be toggled thanks to a very simple JS program (the day 3 `script.js` file) that I wrote.

*You can also view it on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/a-tailwind-site) and see it for yourself at [its page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/day3/tailwind.html)!*

### üåê [Day 4](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/scraper.html)

For [day 4 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-4.devpost.com/), I completed the **web scraper** *(build a web scraper application)* challenge to change things up a little. While this project is still related to websites, there aren't any HTML, CSS or JS files that I'd really consider to be a part of it. The main thing it runs on is Python ‚Äî and I actually ended up building two versions of it. Both scrape content from Marianopolis College's website(s), which is an [anglophone CEGEP in Quebec (click here to find out more about CEGEP!).](https://cw118.github.io/quetudesinfo/)

One version is a command-line tool, in a sense; all of the files needed to run the scraper/tool (Python script and some text files) are found in the `day4` folder of this repo. Full instructions for this version can be found at the [day 4 page of my LHD: Build microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/scraper.html).

The second version is a [self-updating README](https://github.com/cw118/mari-updates) that I coded with a slightly modified version of the Python script from the command-line tool, and then automated using a custom GitHub Action so that the scraper script is run once every day, updating the README with the scraped content each time *(I also added some error checking so that the program lists the links I need to look into and update in the `ERRORS.md` file if the HTTP status code returned isn't `200 OK`)*. I'm so glad to have got this working, since I just started learning GitHub Actions, and it really is a great and powerful integrated tool that I'll probably be using quite a bit in the future. You'll find the code, Actions workflow and the README itself in my [`mari-updates` repo](https://github.com/cw118/mari-updates).

*Read more about the two versions of the scraper I coded on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/mari-web-scraper) and at [the day 4 page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/scraper.html)!*

### üõèÔ∏è Day 5 ("Rest day")

I took a bit of a break for [day 5 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-5.devpost.com/) ‚Äî life got busy, and I didn't have time to create a new mini-project or write programs from scratch. Instead, I continued with my "code a bit every day" commitment by revising and improving my existing code and projects, including this repo (I guess you could count adding this section to the README)! You'll also see that on my [LHD: Build microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build), the Day 5 entry intentionally leads to this heading of the README instead of a page on the site.

I also added some improvements and fixes to my [`mari-updates` web-scraper repo](https://github.com/cw118/mari-updates), including normalizing the unicode of scraped content to avoid errors (I was very lucky to have uncovered this bug while doing some random tests of the Python script out of curiosity), tweaking the `CRON` time for my scheduled Actions workflow, and modifying the file writing process (this edits the README after a web scrape) to append the last update time in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

Some other things I worked on were making various modifications to this repo (any relevant updates, minor changes in `tailwind.html`, and removing superfluous/unnecessary HTML tag classes in `index.html`), as well as a few open source contributions. Lastly, I opened issues to track tasks in my own repos as a sort of reminder for what I want add and enhance.

And yeah, that was about it for today! Hopefully I'll be able to create a hack to submit to Devpost for day 6 ‚Äî even better if it's something that can be live-demoed on my microsite üòä

### üòú [Day 6](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/sillyapis.html)

Back at it again for [LHD: Build day 6](https://lhd-build-day-6.devpost.com/)! I decided to practice my JavaScript, as well as adding and using APIs for this not-very-useful mini-project ‚Äî coincidentally, it combines two of day 6's challenges, "build with an API" and "create a useless invention hack"!

This is a submission you'll be able to see and try for yourself on my [microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build) *(yay!)*. I don't have much to say here, because all the code really does is:
1. Fetch and display [JokesAPI's](https://jokes.one/api/joke/) Joke of the Day,
2. Combine a [Pokemon name](https://pokeapi.co/) (longer names are shortened a bit, plus shoutout to PokeAPI ‚ö°) and the [ISS' altitude coordinate](https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer) (thanks to the *Where the ISS at?* üõ∞Ô∏è API) to generate a "random" username for you. 

If that piques your interest, and/or you're looking for something silly, definitely do [check it out](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/sillyapis.html)!

*Take a look at my [Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/random-apis) and the [day 6 page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/sillyapis.html)!*

### ü•ß [Day 7](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/pi.html)

Wow, LHD: Build really flew by fast! For the [7th and final day of LHD: Build](https://lhd-build-day-6.devpost.com/), which shares a Devpost link with day 6, I worked with Python yet again to implement Nilakantha's Series and calculate `pi`. There's a lot of room for improvement with this project ‚Äî most notably the ridiculously long runtime just to get some digits of pi, as well as the lack of accuracy once you're past the 13th digit after the decimal.

All in all, despite these issues, I had fun coding the simple script and learning more about pi and ways to calculate it. There's no live demo for day 7 on my microsite, but you'll find a summary and some instructions on trying out the Python program on the [day 7 page of the site](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/pi.html). The file containing the pi program is `pi.py` (*get it?* üôÉ) and can be found in the `day7` folder of this repo, so definitely take a look to see my code and for a brief explanation of the Nilakantha Series!

*Take a look at my [Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/pi-with-nilakantha), the [day 7 page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/pi.html), and the [`pi.py` script in this repo](https://github.com/cw118/lhd_build/blob/main/day7/pi.py)!*

### üèÅ *The end*

And that's it for LHD: Build 2022! This hackathon was so much fun ‚Äî I learned and practiced a ton, got to code every day in several languages, and I can't believe how quickly the week went by. Hoping and looking forward to joining Global Hack Week *(Local Hack Day is being rebranded!)* in the future and participating in more MLH events!

Happy hacking everyone üòÑüíª
