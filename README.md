# üõ†Ô∏è LHD: Build

My hackathon projects and programs for MLH's LHD: Build 2022. Most of these are small and simple ‚Äî given the very limited amounts of time I have to spend on coding, this is how I'm making sure to meet my goal of coding as often as possible, even if it means reviewing familiar concepts or taking tiny steps forward in my learning journey.

### ‚õÖ [Day 1](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/weather.html)

I chose the **weather script** *(write a script that checks the weather)* challenge for [day 1 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-1.devpost.com/). My submission consisted of a few `HTML` and `CSS` files, but the star is the JS script (located in the `day1` folder of this repo) ‚Äî it uses `async/await` to fetch information from the OpenWeatherMap API, then dynamically updates the HTML to display weather information for the user's desired city.

### üîÄ [Day 2](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/reversestr.html)

I chose the **string reverse** *(write a script to reverse a string)* challenge for [day 2 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-2.devpost.com/). My submission once again included `HTML` and `CSS` files, with a super simple `JavaScript` program (located in the `day2` folder) as the real star of the show. The JS script uses a `for` loop to add each character of the user-inputted string, starting from the end (last character of its index), into the `reversedStr` variable. The HTML is then dynamically updated to display the resulting reversed string.

Given the simplicity of this challenge, I decided to add a "Copy string" button to learn how to interact with the clipboard using JavaScript. The script detects whether the string is empty, as well as whether the clipboard write was successful, and returns/displays a message to the user based on these checks. If all goes well, the message just says "Copied!"
