### ‚õÖ [Day 1](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/weather.html)

I chose the **weather script** *(write a script that checks the weather)* challenge for [day 1 of Build](https://lhd-build-day-1.devpost.com/). My submission consisted of a few `HTML` and `CSS` files, but the star is the JS script (located in the `day1` folder of this repo) ‚Äî it uses `async/await` to fetch information from the OpenWeatherMap API, then dynamically updates the HTML to display weather information for the user's desired city.

*You can also view it on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/weather-checker) and at [its page on the microsite](https://cw118.github.io/lhd_build/weather.html)!*
