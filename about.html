                <p><strong>LHD: Build</strong> is a week-long <strong>hackathon</strong> comprised of mini-projects and challenges, and one of many, many hackathons hosted by <strong>Major League Hacking (MLH)</strong>. See the <a href="https://localhackday.mlh.io/" target="_blank"class="w3-text-teal" >Local Hack Day (LHD) live site</a> for more details.</p>
                <p>My participation in LHD: Build 2022 is part of my journey to self-learn programming and computer science, and just to practice coding as much as possible in my (quite limited) free time.</p>
                <h3>At this microsite here, you'll find some of my submissions to the 2022 LHD: Build challenges, though the mini-projects that aren't or perhaps can't necessarily be presented on this site will be found in the same <a href="https://github.com/cw118/lhd_build" target="_blank" class="w3-text-teal">GitHub repository</a>.</h3>
                <p>You may have noticed that this site is quite bare-bones â€” it's not particularly pleasing to the eye, nor is it full of content or media. I decided to keep the "design" very simplistic and instead concentrate on completing the challenges, which usually have a focus on various scripts rather than the markup and stylesheets; in other words, my main goal in creating and publishing this portfolio microsite isn't really to make the most beautiful or aesthetic UI (interface).</p>
                <h4>Have fun navigating and happy hacking!</h4>
